    nicode is an international textual character specification that has been adopted by the vast majority of the world's computer industry. Unicode specifies over 120,000 symbols, but currently most browsers and fonts only support a subset of this (though
    support is always growing). It should be noted that the small text you're seeing above is not a font. It's all in the same font, but different character sets are used. Unicode specifies many weird alphabets that can be copy and pasted into Facebook/Tumblr/Twitter/etc.
    posts and profiles. These small text alphabets are just a few of the alphabetical symbol sets contained in Unicode.
